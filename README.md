### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Millenial Happy Moments
+ This project is conducted by Sarah Wu

+ Project summary: This project looks into the idea that women enter adulthood or mature a few years earlier than men. By looking at the happy moments volunteered by individuals from age 26-30, I hope to find insight that supports or does not support this idea.
